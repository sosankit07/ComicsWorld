<h2>Deadpool 2 (2018)</h2>
    <p> The film picks up not long after the first ended, with Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds)
	enjoying a brief period of romantic bliss with his recently rescued fiancée Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). 
	Of course, in true superhero narrative fashion, everything very quickly goes to shit, and through a series of tragic but 
	effortlessly comical circumstances, Wade finds himself donning his Deadpool suit, forming an ‘X-Force’ of various mutants and 
	embroiling himself in an all action, all comedy race against time to interfere in a murderous plan that has the potential to change both past and future timeline events.
<br>
If you enjoyed the first Deadpool, then it’s a safe bet that you are going to enjoy this one too. The filmmakers have effectively stuck to the formula 
that worked so well in 2016, but turned the dial up another two or three notches. On a plot level, Deadpool 2 isn’t quite as streamlined and 
clean as its predecessor, but the vulgar, irreverent humour and fun, inventive action sequences are all present in abundance.
 If anything, one might be justified in criticising the film for playing it ‘too safe’ in terms of tried and tested formula, 
 but when that formula is already so out of the ordinary and different, it’s not so much of a big deal.

<h2>DragonBall Thriller</h2>
    <p>Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were the first anime I watched and finished. They had likeable and engaging characters, 
	memorable stories and designs and great action. However, there was always one character, in particular, that I never liked: Android #17.<br>

When introduced in Dragon Ball Z, Android #17, alongside his sister Android #18, were teenagers kidnapped by a mad scientist named Dr Gero and
 converted into cyborgs, and programmed into performing one task; killing Son Goku, the protagonist of the series as an act of revenge for his destruction
 of the Red Ribbon Army, a terrorist organisation Gero was a part of. However, despite their conversion into becoming partially robotic, with bombs placed inside
 them as a safety precaution, these two characters have very human emotions. Android #17 is impulsive, sociopathic and pretty sadistic in regards to human life. 
 His sister is much more relaxed and forgiving.
<br>
They are accompanied by a fully robotic companion named Android #16, a nature-loving robot who is only going to kill Son Goku because 
he was ordered and programmed to by Gero, in contrast to Android 17, who whilst also being ordered to kill Goku, is also excited at the idea.
However, 17 and 18 harbour extreme hatred towards their creator/kidnapper for his violations and experiments, and thus murder him.
The trio travel together in search of Goku, learning about each other and bonding with Android 16, who grows to become friends with them and expresses his love of nature repeatedly.
 <br>

Android #17 in the Androids Saga was akin to many other villains of Z. He was cocky, egotistical, sociopathic and talkative.
 He didn’t stand out from many already seen before in the franchise. 
 He was never a character I enjoyed. Later on in the story, he is absorbed by Cell, a synthetic lifeform who absorbs 17 and 18 to reach his ‘perfect’ state of absolute power,
 becoming the strongest villain in the franchise at that point. 
 It is revealed that 17 and 18 are still conscious inside Cell’s body and are thus aware of things still happening even though they’ve been absorbed.</p>

<h2>The cave suits you better!</h2>
    <p>This is simply a realization that I had, and its why I think Batman is the greatest superhero ever.

You could look at this question from two perspectives: <br>
1) list specific facts and events that make Batman appear to be the greatest or <br>
2) try and find an underlying theme among all stories involving Batman and use that as your justification.

Batman, at a very young age, lost the only thing he truly loved (his parents). 
A tragedy that has given him the gift of rational and emotionless clarity of thought throughout the rest of his life. 
This is by far a very superhuman trait, and because of it, he is literally able to dismantle gods. 
This is also why Superman refers to him as the most dangerous man on the planet.<br>
Everything about Batman stories points to this ability. 
His justified paranoia of anything powerful, his meticulous planning, the contingency plans, the reclusive introverted nature of his personality, and so on.

<br>
Because of this ability/trait that has arisen from the childhood tragedy, Batman has become truly incorruptible. 
Writers often have an easy time writing stories about the other heroes become evil. 
Why? Because these heroes are controlled by their emotions (ironically, a very human trait). 
They have love interests, they have families, they make emotional decisions.
There has been an instance in the DC superhero realm where every superhero has had an evil version of him or herself (mostly in multi-dimensional stories). 
However, Batman is always the one that remains incorruptible in every single one of those stories, 
in every dimension that those writers dream up, nobody can write a convincing story of an evil Batman.  </p>
